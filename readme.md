# snake game project


Here are three Snake game projects implemented in Python:

## 1. **Interactive Snake Game**:  
   An interactive Snake game where the player controls the direction of the snake using the keyboard to eat food.

```angular2html
python snake_game.py
```

## 2. **Optimal Path Snake Algorithm**:  
   A Snake game using intelligent algorithms to calculate the optimal path, enabling the snake to autonomously move, eat food, and maximize the score.
```angular2html
python snake_game_algo.py
```

## 3. **Reinforcement Learning Snake Agent**:  
   A Snake game based on reinforcement learning, where a Snake agent learns game strategies through interaction with the environment to maximize its score.
